ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project explores why people become religious, examining the causal relationship between the degree of religiosity and the factors that make someone religious.

Instead of viewing religion merely as belief, the study treats religiosity as a measurable phenomenon influenced by psychological, social, cultural, and economic factors.

ðŸŽ¯ Research Objective

To identify and analyze the key determinants that make someone religious and to measure how each factor causally influences their level of religiosity.

ðŸ§© Core Research Questions

What factors (e.g., family, culture, education, trauma, fear, social environment) most strongly predict how religious a person becomes?

Is religiosity inherited, taught, or chosen?

Are there observable psychological or social causal mechanisms behind religious belief?

How do education, economic status, and political ideology mediate religiosity?
