What Makes Someone Religious?
Exploring the Causal Relationship Between Religiosity and Its Determinants
ðŸ“˜ Overview

This project investigates why people become religious â€” analyzing the causal relationship between the degree of religiosity and the various factors that contribute to it.

Rather than treating religion as a simple belief system, this study views religiosity as a multidimensional construct influenced by psychological, social, cultural, and environmental causes.

ðŸŽ¯ Research Objective

To identify and understand the key determinants that make someone religious and to measure how strongly each factor causally influences a personâ€™s religiosity.

ðŸ§© Core Research Questions

What factors (e.g., family, culture, education, trauma, fear, social environment) most strongly predict how religious a person becomes?

Is religiosity inherited, taught, or chosen?

Are there measurable psychological or social causal patterns behind religious belief?

How does education, economic condition, or political ideology mediate religiosity?
